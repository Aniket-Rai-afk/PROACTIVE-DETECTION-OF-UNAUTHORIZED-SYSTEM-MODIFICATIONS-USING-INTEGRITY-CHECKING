File Integrity Checker - Project Brief
Overview
The File Integrity Checker is a Bash-based tool designed to monitor changes in files and directories by comparing their current state against a previously recorded baseline. It helps detect unauthorized modifications, accidental changes, or potential security breaches by tracking alterations in file permissions, ownership, size, timestamps, and other critical attributes.

Key Features
✔ Baseline Creation – Takes a snapshot of a directory’s structure and file metadata.
✔ Change Detection – Compares current files against the baseline to identify modifications.
✔ Priority-Based Reporting – Categorizes changes into High, Medium, and Low priority for easy analysis.
✔ Automated Checks – Can be scheduled (e.g., via cron) for regular integrity monitoring.
✔ Cross-Platform Support – Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL/Cygwin).
